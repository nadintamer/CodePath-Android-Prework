## "Hello World!" Android App (CodePath Android Pre-Work) ✨

### App Description
This is my first ever Android app, completed with guidance from CodePath tutorials. The app has several different elements that allow the user to interact with the user interface, including: a button that changes the text of the label, a button that changes the app's background color, a button that changes the text color, and a text field & button that allow the user to set a custom string for the label text. The user can also tap on the background view to reset all the views to their default settings.
